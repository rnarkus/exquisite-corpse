            <p>It was a quiet evening at the Cabin up in the Rocky Mountains. The fireplace was slowly dying and I could hear rustling in the leaves outside the window. I decided to walk outside to check things out. I opened the front door and was greeted by a stray dog. It scurried away and I went back inside and laughed it off. Suddenly...</p>
            <p>All the lights in the cabin went out, except for the fireplace. There was a adurpt thud on the side of the cabin. The fire grew bigger and bigger, the scorching flames had light the curtains on fire. I had to ditch the cabin. As soon as I ran out of the cabin. I had this feeling that someone was watching me from the deep dark woods. A loud howl came from the a pair of red eyes to the left of me. My hair stood up and I wasn't sure what to do. Then I decided to... </p>
            <p>CONFRONT THOSE GLARING RED EYES. I was scared as shit but I knew what I had to do. I wasn't going to die today. I walked closer, slowly. As I carefully approached the figure its grotesque features became clear. I had never seen such horrific deformities in a being. This creature was unreal, I thought I was dreaming. BUT I WASN'T. I starred back in those beady eyes and spat right in his face.</p>
            <p>The <em>creature's</em> eyes opened wide. It knocked back its head and let out a screeching howl. All the windows in the cabin shattered at that moment and my ears were ringing. The creature jumped near the front door and acted as if it was waiting for back up before devouring me. I was freaking out at this point and slowly creep to the fireplace while I felt big beady eyes on my back. I armed myself with two fireplace tools and started to meditate before (what I thought) the forthcoming battle between man and creature</p>
            <p>When I thought things could not get any worse, it did. I heard the branches cracking behind me and growl. Zombies were surrounding me! I screamed and grabbed the closest branch. I sprinted and hit a couple zombies down. The closest neighbor to my cabin was only three miles down the road. As I got closer to my neighbors cabin I noticed that there lights flickering in the window. The front door to my neighbors was broken down and there was blood everywhere. I saw at the side of my eye a bloody hatchet. I grabbed it and went to find their phone. As I came upon the phone it I noticed the phone line was cut.</p>
            <p> "Ah shit" I said quietly to myself. I know the closest town is 5 miles from here so I start to walk down the main road. I cant see or hear anything around me. I finally feel at ease, but the thought of the rest of the state or event he country slowly turning into zombies was insane. I see something running down the road... it's the dog from earlier! He gets about 10 feet away from me and then just sits and stares at me. Then he slowly turns around and starts walking towards the town. I think he wants me to follow him. I think this is really strange but I enjoy the companion for the time being...</p>
            <p>Then I keep walking down the road then I heard a car on the rocky road. As it gets closer I am more at ease that this person can help me. Finally the car and I meet, as it stops right in front it just sits there for a few seconds. I yell over to the car, "Hey can you help me?!" Then the car turns on it brights and it starts to charge at me. I jump out of the way and the car keeps on driving. I get myself back and and continue on the road back to town. </p>
            <p>Something doesn't feel right to me. I have this overwhelming feeling that someone is watching me. I turn around, but all I see is darkness and an empty road. I suddenly hear a faint voice and look around. I still don't see anyone. I hear it again and look down. I had come across a cartopf! This small creature was unlike most monsters that I had come across before. Cartopfs are good luck, but only if you treat them with respect. I picked up the monster from the ground, he was blue with green freckles. He had one large eye and more than one hundred sharp teeth. He fit right in the palm of my hand. I asked him "do you know where the next city is?".</p>
            <p>The cartopf made a really weird low growl and used one of its pointy fingers to point in the direction of the town. But it wasnt down the road and instead through the trees. "Should I trust it?" I said to myself. This creature, although small and brings good luck, is just so ugly and could bite my hand off at any moment. I sprint towards the trees and the cartopf is acting like a compass slowly mocing its hand in the direction of the town. Well, at least I hope its the town.</p>
            <p>I have been running through the trees for about 20 minutes. I stop and gasp for air. I start to think that I shouldn't have put my trust the cartopf to give me directions, but I didn't want to be rude and question its judgement. If I made it angry then it could attack. The cartopf looks at me and I look back, then I hear it say "The next town is just 300 yards away, pull yourself together I have somewhere I need to be". I am suprised by this, cartopfs are not usually social creatures. "Can I come with you?" I ask and the cartopf starts to grin, showing its hundreds of little sharp teeth. With a menacing tone the cartopf says "Yes of course you can".  </p>
            <p>The cartopf leads me over a hill and on the other side I see a huge bonfire. Surrounding the bonfire are monsters of every shape, color, and size. I had never seen so many creatures in one place. Anyone with their right mind would turn around and run, but I couldn't because if I did I would make the cartopf mad and it would attack. Instead, I someone pushed one foot in front of another and moved closer to the monsters. There was no telling if they would be in a good mood or not. When I got close enough the cartopf started announcing that he had brought a human with him. All the monsters turned to look at me and grinned. My body started shaking, what have I done? </p>
            <p>I thought the worse thing could happen to me, I would never get to say "good-bye" to my family and die a painful death.They were just patiently waiting for me sit next to them. As I sat down next to the Werewolf and the Seamonster, the werewolf howled at the moon and started the ritual. Sitting across from me was a witch staring at me. I was creeped out by the way she was staring. Her eyes rolled to the back of her head and walked over to me. I knew this was it for me. In her right hand was a sharp pointed dagger.</p>
            <p>Those eyeballs were incredible, the way they walked. It was like they had a mind of their own. This witch must have been one of the best in the West as far as magical capabilites goes. Her eyeballs literally WALKED out of her head, and from the back! They created two gaping holes in the back of her skull and she didn't even seem at all fazed by the injury. I was stunned.</p>
            <p>As she got closer to me, I quickly thought of every way I could possible get out of this situation, but before I could make a move she had the dagger only a couple of inches away from me. I squeezed my eyes shut. I felt something push into the side of my body, but it wasn't sharp. I opened one eye and looked down only to realize that the witch was sticking the back of the dagger into my side. Then her eyes rolled back into her head and she told me to take the dagger. I quickly grabbed it from her hand. Then all the monsters started to chant around me. The witch, who hadn't stopped staring at me this whole time, told me to draw blood with the dagger. "It is the only way" she said. Only way for what?, I thought to myself. I started to push the dagger into my arm. I knew it was crazy, but I couldn't stop myself. I had no control over my own body. I drew blood and suddenly the chanting stopped.</p>
            <p>The fire started to crackle and spark furiously. The flames rose and rose, spiraling upward towards the tops of the trees. I looked deep into the golden yellow vortex and saw began to see something. First, my father, and my brother. They looked back at me, with teary eyes. Then my mother appeared with them, but as a frail old lady. My father and brother too began to age rapidly before my eyes, before all three of them vanished into ash.</p>
            <p>I went home and made oatmeal. Not the instant kind, but real home-cookin' style, stovetop, whole oats and a splash of locally-sourced organic free-range gluten-free two percent. Usually I prefer almond or soy because I have a sensitive stomache but I was really feeling it today. God I love milk.</p>
