            <p>It was a quiet evening at the Cabin up in the Rocky Mountains. The fireplace was slowly dying and I could hear rustling in the leaves outside the window. I decided to walk outside to check things out. I opened the front door and was greeted by a stray dog. It scurried away and I went back inside and laughed it off. Suddenly...</p>
            <p>All the lights in the cabin went out, except for the fireplace. There was a adurpt thud on the side of the cabin. The fire grew bigger and bigger, the scorching flames had light the curtains on fire. I had to ditch the cabin. As soon as I ran out of the cabin. I had this feeling that someone was watching me from the deep dark woods. A loud howl came from the a pair of red eyes to the left of me. My hair stood up and I wasn't sure what to do. Then I decided to... </p>
            <p>CONFRONT THOSE GLARING RED EYES. I was scared as shit but I knew what I had to do. I wasn't going to die today. I walked closer, slowly. As I carefully approached the figure its grotesque features became clear. I had never seen such horrific deformities in a being. This creature was unreal, I thought I was dreaming. BUT I WASN'T. I starred back in those beady eyes and spat right in his face.</p>
            <p>The <em>creature's</em> eyes opened wide. It knocked back its head and let out a screeching howl. All the windows in the cabin shattered at that moment and my ears were ringing. The creature jumped near the front door and acted as if it was waiting for back up before devouring me. I was freaking out at this point and slowly creep to the fireplace while I felt big beady eyes on my back. I armed myself with two fireplace tools and started to meditate before (what I thought) the forthcoming battle between man and creature</p>
