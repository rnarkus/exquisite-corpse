            <p>It was a quiet evening at the Cabin up in the Rocky Mountains. The fireplace was slowly dying and I could hear rustling in the leaves outside the window. I decided to walk outside to check things out. I opened the front door and was greeted by a stray dog. It scurried away and I went back inside and laughed it off. Suddenly...</p>
            <p>All the lights in the cabin went out, except for the fireplace. There was a adurpt thud on the side of the cabin. The fire grew bigger and bigger, the scorching flames had light the curtains on fire. I had to ditch the cabin. As soon as I ran out of the cabin. I had this feeling that someone was watching me from the deep dark woods. A loud howl came from the a pair of red eyes to the left of me. My hair stood up and I wasn't sure what to do. Then I decided to... </p>
            <p>CONFRONT THOSE GLARING RED EYES. I was scarred as shit but I knew waht I had to do. I wasn't going to die today. I walked closer, slowly. As I carefully approached the figure its grotesque features became clear. I had never seen such horrific deformities in a being. This creature was unreal, I thought I was dreaming. BUT I WASN"T. I starred back in those beady eyes and spat right in his face.</p>
