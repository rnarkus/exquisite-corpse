            <p>It was a quiet evening at the Cabin up in the Rocky Mountains. The fireplace was slowly dying and I could hear rustling in the leaves outside the window. I decided to walk outside to check things out. I opened the front door and was greeted by a stray dog. It scurried away and I went back inside and laughed it off. Suddenly...</p>
            <p>All the lights in the cabin went out, except for the fireplace. There was a adurpt thud on the side of the cabin. The fire grew bigger and bigger, the scorching flames had light the curtains on fire. I had to ditch the cabin. As soon as I ran out of the cabin. I had this feeling that someone was watching me from the deep dark woods. A loud howl came from the a pair of red eyes to the left of me. My hair stood up and I wasn't sure what to do. Then I decided to... </p>
            <p>CONFRONT THOSE GLARING RED EYES. I was scared as shit but I knew what I had to do. I wasn't going to die today. I walked closer, slowly. As I carefully approached the figure its grotesque features became clear. I had never seen such horrific deformities in a being. This creature was unreal, I thought I was dreaming. BUT I WASN'T. I starred back in those beady eyes and spat right in his face.</p>
            <p>The <em>creature's</em> eyes opened wide. It knocked back its head and let out a screeching howl. All the windows in the cabin shattered at that moment and my ears were ringing. The creature jumped near the front door and acted as if it was waiting for back up before devouring me. I was freaking out at this point and slowly creep to the fireplace while I felt big beady eyes on my back. I armed myself with two fireplace tools and started to meditate before (what I thought) the forthcoming battle between man and creature</p>
            <p>When I thought things could not get any worse, it did. I heard the branches cracking behind me and growl. Zombies were surrounding me! I screamed and grabbed the closest branch. I sprinted and hit a couple zombies down. The closest neighbor to my cabin was only three miles down the road. As I got closer to my neighbors cabin I noticed that there lights flickering in the window. The front door to my neighbors was broken down and there was blood everywhere. I saw at the side of my eye a bloody hatchet. I grabbed it and went to find their phone. As I came upon the phone it I noticed the phone line was cut.</p>
            <p> "Ah shit" I said quietly to myself. I know the closest town is 5 miles from here so I start to walk down the main road. I cant see or hear anything around me. I finally feel at ease, but the thought of the rest of the state or event he country slowly turning into zombies was insane. I see something running down the road... it's the dog from earlier! He gets about 10 feet away from me and then just sits and stares at me. Then he slowly turns around and starts walking towards the town. I think he wants me to follow him. I think this is really strange but I enjoy the companion for the time being...</p>
            <p>Then I keep walking down the road then I hear a car on the rocky road. As it gets closer I am more at ease that this person can help me. Finally the car and I meet, as it stops right in front it just sits there for a few seconds. I yell over to the car, "Hey can you help me?!" Then the car turns on it brights and it starts to charge at me. I jump out of the way and the car keeps on driving. I get myself back and and continue on the road back to town. </p>
            <p>Something doesn't feel right to me. I have this overwhelming feeling that someone is watching me. I turn around, but all I see is darkness and an empty road. I suddenly hear a faint voice and look around. I still don't see anyone. I hear it again and look down. I had come across a cartopf! This small creature was unlike most monsters that I had come across before. Cartopfs are good luck, but only if you treat them with respect. I picked up the monster from the ground, he was blue with green freckles. He had one large eye and more than one hundred sharp teeth. He fit right in the palm of my hand. I asked him "do you know where the next city is?".</p>
